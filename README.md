# Study Timer

## Experimental Frontend Project with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS

This is a small frontend project I'm building using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It's based on a project developed during a **React course from Alura**.

The main goal of this project is to **experiment and practice** with modern frontend tools and frameworks to improve my experience and skills in frontend development.
